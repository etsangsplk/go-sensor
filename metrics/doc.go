/*
Package metrics provides supporting APIs for metrics instrumentation. Metrics instrumentation of SSC services is mostly done with the Prometheus client APIs. The ssc-observation/metrics package provides additional common components such as http middleware. Instrumenting a service with metrics enables monitoring, alerting, troubleshooting and service capacity planning scenarios.

Conceptual documentation can be found in the repository READMEs.
